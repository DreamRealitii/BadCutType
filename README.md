# BadCutType
What the mod does:
- When you get a bad cut, replace the "x" with red text of the bad cut reason.
- There are apparently four reasons. I thought there were only two.
- The bad cut types (according to Beat Saber code): WrongDirection, WrongColor, TooSoon, and CutHarder.

Issues:
- Sometimes displays WrongDirection message in replays, even when the cut isn't bad.

To do list:
- Add an in-game enable/disable setting.
- Let players choose the color of the bad cut text.
- Other languages?

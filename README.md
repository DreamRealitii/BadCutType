# BadCutType
What the mod does:
- When you get a bad cut, replace the "x" with text of the bad cut reason.
- There are apparently four bad cut reasons. I thought there were only two.
- The bad cut types (according to Beat Saber code): WrongDirection, WrongColor, TooSoon, and CutHarder.
- Has settings to enable/disable, change font size/color, write your own text for each bad cut type.

Issues:
- Sometimes displays a bad cut message in replays, even when the cut isn't bad.

To do list:
- Other languages?
